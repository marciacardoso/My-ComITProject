    <h1>First Aid Survey Steps</h1>
    <h2>Primary and Secondary Steps</h2>

        </figure>
        <h2>PRIMARY STEPS:</h2>
        <p> When you encounter an ill or injured person, you will repeat the check, call, care steps until the person´s condition
                improves or EMS personnel arrive.</p>
        <h2>1-CHECK:</h2>       
        <h3>CHECK THE SCENE:</h3>
        <h4>Before approaching an ill or injured person, stop and take a good look at the scene:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Is the scene safe?</li>
            <li>Are there any hazards?</li>
            <li>What happened?</li>
            <li>How did it happen?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <h3>CHECK THE PERSON:</h3>
        <p>If the scene is safe, quickly check the person:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check if the person is reponsive;</li>
            <li>Check the ABCs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Airway </li>
                    <li>Breathing</li>
                    <li>Circulation</li>
                </ul>   
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Checking ABCs:</h4>
        <h4>Airway:</h4>
        <p><figure>
                <img src="images/airWay.jpg" alt="checkairWay" title="Air">
                <figcaption>Check the Airway</figcaption>
            </figure></p>
        <p>Make sure the person has an open airway. If the person is speaking, moaning, or crying, the person´s airway is open.
                If the person is unresponsive, perform a head-tilt/chin-lift by gently tilting the head back until the chin is pointing up.</p>    
        <hr>
        <h4>Breathing:</h4>
        <p> <figure>
                <img src="images/checkBreathing.jpg" alt="checkbreathing" title="Breathing">
                <figcaption>Check the Breathing</figcaption>
            </figure></p>
        <p>Check for normal breathing for 5 to 10 seconds. A person is breathing normally if air is moving into and out of the lungs and the chest is rising and falling in a normal, regular pattern. Someone who can speak or cry is breathing.</p>    
        <hr>
        <h4>Circulation:</h4>
        <p> <figure>
                <img src="images/circulation.jpg" alt="circulation" title="blood">
                <figcaption>Check the Circulation</figcaption>
            </figure></p>
        <p>Quickly look at the person from head to toe for signs of life-threatening bleeding.</p>    
        <hr>
    </div>
    <h2>2-CALL EMS/9-1-1:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If an individual is unresponsive or has a life-threatening condition, you must always activate EMS.</li>
        <li>Whenever possible, use a mobile phone or ask a bystander to call EMS/9-1-1.</li>
        <li>If you are alone with the person and you do not have a mobile phone, call out loudly for help. If no one comes, get to a phone as quickly as you can and call EMS/9-1-1. As soon as you hang up, return to the person.</li>
        <li>  If a person becomes unresponsive or his or her vital signs deteriorate, call EMS/9-1-1 immediately.</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>3-CARE:</h2>
    <p>Care for any life-threatening conditions first. Give the care that is needed, within the scope of your knowledge and training. Continue to Check, Call and Care, providing continual care with these guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Monitor the person´s breathing, level os responsiveness, and overall condition.</li>
            <li>Help the person rest in a comfortable position.</li>
			<li>If necessary, roll the person into the<b> "recovery position"(1)</b>.</li>
			<li>Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated.</li>
			<li>Reassure the person.</li>
			<li>Help the person with medication: if it is safe, if the person is responsive and has in some way expressed a need for help finding, preparing, and/or taking the madication.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><b>(1)"Recovery Position":</b> a person who is unresponsive or has an altered level of responsiveness should be rolled into the recovery position. When placing a person in the recovery position, remember:</h4>

            <figcaption>Recovery Position 1</figcaption>
            <img src="images/recoveryPosition.jpg" alt="recoveryPosition2" title="rec2">
            <figcaption>Recovery Position 2</figcaption>
                </figure></p>
    </figure></p>
    <ul>
            <li>Support and protect the head while rolling the person;</li>
            <li>Try to roll the person as one unit (head, back, and legs at the same time);</li>
            <li>Roll the person into a position where the body will stay safely on its side;</li>
            <li>Check the ABCs after you complete the roll.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>SECONDARY STEPS:</h2>
    <P>Once you are confident that all life-threatening conditions have been addressed, perform a secondary assessment to check for conditions that may not be as obvious. The secondary assessmente consists of three steps:</P>
    <h3>1- Ask SAMPLE questions:</h3>
    <p> Interview the ill or injured person and any bystanders at the scene using the acronym SAMPLE to guide your questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>S igns and symptoms</li>   
        <li>A llergies</li>    
        <li>M edications</li>   
        <li>P ast medical history</li>   
        <li>L ast oral intake(food or drink)</li>   
        <li> E vents leading up to the emergency</li>   
    </ul>
    <h3>2- Check the vital signs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Level of Responsiveness: is the person alert, sleepy, or confused? Is the person´s responsiveness changing?</li>   
        <li>Breathing: listen for sounds. Is the breathing fast or slow? Shallow or deep? Painful?</li>    
        <li>Skin: Is skin dry or wet? An unusual colour or temperature?</li>   
    </ul>
    <h3>3- Perform an Injury Check:</h3>
    <p> look carefully for injuries that were not identified during the primary assessment. An injury check may involve a focused examination or a hands-on check. If you find a medical-identification product during your check, read it carefully.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Level of Responsiveness: is the person alert, sleepy, or confused? Is the person´s responsiveness changing?</li>   
        <li>Breathing: listen for sounds. Is the breathing fast or slow? Shallow or deep? Painful?</li>    
        <li>Skin: Is skin dry or wet? An unusual colour or temperature?</li>   
    </ul>
    <h3>4- Focused Examination: </h3>
    <p> If the person is responsive and able to answer questions, do a focused examination. If the person´s condition deteriorates, respond immediately.(call 9-1-1, provide care).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain that the purpose of the examination is to identify injuries.</li>   
        <li> Ask the person if anything hurts or feels uncomfortable.</li>    
        <li>If the person indicates an area of pain or concern, look at the area for signs of injury.</li> 
        <li>Ask focused questions about how the person feels.</li>  
    </ul>
    <h3>5- Hands-on check: </h3>
    <p>  If a person is breathing but unresponsive or unable to communicate, you may need to do a hands-on check. Begin by cheking the head for injuries, and then work downward, focusing on the chest, abdomen, and legs before checking tha arms.</p>
