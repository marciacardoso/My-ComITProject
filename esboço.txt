L1- First Aid Survey Steps: primary and secondary.

	PRIMARY STEPS:

		 When you encounter an ill or injured person, you will repeat the check, call, care steps until the person´s condition improves or EMS personnel arrive.

		1- Check: once you recognize an emergency, you must first check the scene, and then check the person.
			a- Check the scene: Before approaching an ill or injured person, stop and take a good look at the scene:
				- Is the scene safe?
				- Are there any hazards?
				- What happened?
				- How did it happen?
			b- Check the person: If the scene is safe, quickly check the person:
				- Check whether the person is responsive.
				- Check the person´s ABCs:
					*Airway;
					*Breathing;
					*Circulation;

			c- Checking ABCs:

				A= CHECK THE AIRWAY: Make sure the person has an open airway. If the person is speaking, moaning, or crying, the person´s airway is open.
									If the person is unresponsive, perform a head-tilt/chin-lift by gently tilting the head back until the chin is pointing up.

				B= CHECK BREATHING: check for normal breathing for 5 to 10 seconds. A person is breathing normally if air is moving into and out of the lungs and the chest is rising and falling in a normal, regular pattern. Someone who can speak or cry is breathing.

				C= CHECK CIRCULATION: quickly look at the person from head to toe for signs of life-threatening bleeding.

			- "Agonal respiration": A person who is not breathing normally may be occasionally gasping for air: this is a reflex action called "agonal respiration". Unlike normal breathing, it is irregular and sporadic. Care for the person as if he or she is not breathing.
			- Unresponsiveness, difficulty breathing, and life-threatening bleeding are life-threatening emergencies.These conditions must be your top priority. Obtain an automated external defibrillator (AED) and first aid kit if these items are available.

		2- Call: If an individual is unresponsive or has a life-threatening condition, you must always activate EMS. Whenever possible, use a mobile phone or ask a bystander to call EMS/9-1-1.
			If you are alone with the person and you do not have a mobile phone, call out loudly for help. If no one comes, get to a phone as quickly as you can and call EMS/9-1-1. As soon as you hang up, return to the person.
			If a person becomes unresponsive or his or her vital signs deteriorate, call EMS/9-1-1 immediately.

		3- Care: Care for any life-threatening conditions first. Give the care that is needed, within the scope of your knowledge and training. Continue to Check, Call and Care, providing continual care with these guidelines:
			- monitor the person´s breathing, level os responsiveness, and overall condition.
			- help the person rest in a comfortable position.
			- if necessary, roll the person into the "recovery position" (1).
			- keep the person from getting chilled or overheated.
			- reassure the person.
			- help the person with medication: if it is safe, if the person is responsive and has in some way expressed a need for help finding, preparing, and/or taking the madication.

			(1)"Recovery position": a person who is unresponsive or has an altered level of responsiveness should be rolled into the recovery position. When placing a person in the recovery position, remember:
			- Support and protect the head while rolling the person;
			- Try to roll the person as one unit (head, back, and legs at the same time);
			- Roll the person into a position where the body will stay safely on its side;
			- Check the ABCs after you complete the roll.

	SECONDARY STEPS:

		Once you are confident that all life-threatening conditions have been addressed, perform a secondary assessment to check for conditions that may not be as obvious. The secondary assessmente consists of three steps:

		1- Ask SAMPLE questions: Interview the ill or injured person and any bystanders at the scene using the acronym SAMPLE to guide your questions:

		 S igns and symptoms
		 A llergies
		 M edications
		 P ast medical history
		 L ast oral intake(food or drink)
		 E vents leading up to the emergency

		2- Check the vital signs:

			- Level of Responsiveness: is the person alert, sleepy, or confused? Is the person´s responsiveness changing?
			- Breathing: listen for sounds. Is the breathing fast or slow? Shallow or deep? Painful?
			- Skin: Is skin dry or wet? An unusual colour or temperature?

		3- Perform an Injury Check: look carefully for injuries that were not identified during the primary assessment. An injury check may involve a focused examination or a hands-on check. If you find a medical-identification product during your check, read it carefully.

			FOCUSED EXAMINATION: 
			If the person is responsive and able to answer questions, do a focused examination. If the person´s condition deteriorates, respond immediately.(call 9-1-1, provide care).

			1- Explain that the purpose of the examination is to identify injuries.
			2- Ask the person if anything hurts or feels uncomfortable.
			3- If the person indicates an area of pain or concern, look at the area for signs of injury.
			4- Ask focused questions about how the person feels.

			HANDS-ON CHECK:
			If a person is breathing but unresponsive or unable to communicate, you may need to do a hands-on check. Begin by cheking the head for injuries, and then work downward, focusing on the chest, abdomen, and legs before checking tha arms.


L2- Emergencies:
	- Wound Care{

	.KNOCKED-OUT TEETH: 
        1- It is often caused by:
		 		- a blow to the mouth;
				- an accident involving the face;
				- while playing contact sports.
				 The tooth can be replaced in the socket successfully if you take the right action as soon as possible.
		2- Check: check the scene quickly to figure out if the local is safe for you and check the person;		 

		3- Call: Call EMS/9-1-1 if the tooth was knocked out by a forceful blow or if you suspect more serious injuries.

		4- Care: 
				- Have the person bite down on a clean dressing;
				- Carefully pick up the tooth by the crown (the white part) and keep it protected;
				- Protect the tooth by putting it in egg white, coconut water, saline or whole milk, or wrapping the tooth in gauze or a clean cloth with some of the person´s saliva;


	.CUTS AND SCRAPES: a cut is a wound where the skin has been split open or torn away. The edges of the wound can be jagged or smooth.
	Scrapes are wounds where the skin has been rubbed or scraped away.
		1- It is often caused by:
				- Any action or sharp object that rubs or scrapes the skin away;
		2- Check: check the scene quickly to figure out if the local is safe for you and check the person;	
			  Check the person:
				- if the person is responsive;
				- Check the person´s ABCs; 
				and look for:
				- possible bleeding;
				- pain;
		3- Call: Call EMS/9-1-1 if you suspect there may be more serious injuries.

		4- Care:
				- Ensure the person´s ABCs are present;
				- Perform a secondary survey and treat any non-life-threatening conditions;
				- If the gloves are not available, use some other kind of barrier between your hand and the wound. If possible, have the injured person use her own hand.
				- There is usually minimal bleeding with scrapes. If this is the case, go directly to step 2(wash the wound with water and soap). If there is bleeding, put direct pressure on the wound until it stops.
				- Wash the wound throroughly with soap and water.
				- If possible, rinse the wound for five minutes with clean, running tap water.
				- If an antibiotic ointment or cream is available, put it on the wound as recommended by a pharmacist after checking the Five Rigths os Medication. Ask the person if she has sensitivity to any antibiotics, such as penicillin.
				If so, do not apply the ointment.
				- Cover the wound with sterile non-stick dressing and/or bandage.
				- Watch for signs of infection. 
				- If the blood soaks through the dressings, add more dressings on top. Do not remove the soaked dressings that are in direct contact with the wound! If you cannot control the bleeding, make sure the person gets medical attention immediately.
				- A STITCH IN TIME: 
					-Wounds should be stitched by a trained medical professional in the first few hours after an injury. A wound may require stitching if:
					 * the edges of the skin do not fall together.
					 * the wound is more than 2.5 cm (1 in.) long.
					 * the wound is near joints on the hands or feet.
					 * the wound is on the face.
					-Stitches will help:
					 * speed up healing.
					 * reduce the chance of infection.
					 * leave a less noticeable scar. 

						



    .BRUISES: is a discoloured area of the skin that is created when blood and other fluids seep into nearby tissues.
		1- It is often caused by:
				- Some kind of blow or impact to the body;

		2- Check: the scene quickly to figure out if the local is safe for you.
	        Check the person:
				- if the person is responsive;
				- Check the person´s ABCs; 
				and look for:
				- Discolouring (red, purple, black or blue areas);
				- Swelling;
				- Pain;
		3- Call: Call EMS/9-1-1 if you suspect there may be more serious injuries.

		4- Care: 
				- Ensure the person´s ABCs are present;
				- Perform a secondary survey and treat any non-life-threatening conditions;
				- Cool the area to help reduce pain and swelling;
				- When you cool the area, put some sort of cloth or pad between the ice and the skin;
				- Apply the ice for 20 minutes of every hour for as long as the person keeps feeling pain. 
				- If the person feels severe pain or cannot move a body part without pain, or if you think the fprce that caused the injury was great enough to cause serious damage or severe bleeding, call EMS/9-1-1
				and getan AED immediately. You may be dealing with internal bleeding, head and/or spine injuries, or bone, muscle, and joint injuries. 
				   				 

		.DEADLY BLEEDING : is severe bleeding that leads to large amounts of blood loss, either outside or within the body. Deadly bleeding must be controlled immediately or it can become life-threatening.

		1- Check: the scene quickly to figure out if the local is safe for you.
	        Check the person:
				- if the person is responsive;
				- Check the person´s ABCs; 

		2- Call: Have someone call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED. If you are alone, call EMS/9-1-1 yourself, get an AED, then return to care for the person.

				- Label the container that contains the body part (person´s name, date and time);
				- Make sure the amputated part goes with the injured person to the hospital;
				- Provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive;
				- If the limb is partially disconnected form the body, put the limb back in palce and treat the injury as an open wound or fracture;

        .BURNS: burns are soft-tissue injuries caused by chemicals, electricity, heat or radiation. Burns can be: superficial, partial thickness, full thickness.
		1- Check:  the scene quickly to figure out if the local is safe for you.
	        Check the person:
				- if the person is responsive;

				- the burns were caused by chemicals, explosions or electricity;
				- the burns are full thickness or involve a large amount of blistered or broken skin;
				- the burns cover the face, neck, hands, genitals or a larger surface area;

		3- Care: 
				- cool the affected area with water or a clean, cool (but not freezing) compress for at least 10 minutes;
				- remove the jewellery and clothing from the burn site, but not attempt to remove anything that is stuck to the skin;
				- cover the burn loosely with a dry, sterile dressing;
				-Superficial burns: once the burning has stopped, you can apply an antibiotic ointment; 
		
		  }

	- Choking;

	- HEAD, NECK AND SPINAL INJURIES: you should suspect a head, neck, and/or spinal injury in the following situations:
				- a fall from any height greater than the height of the person;
				- a diving injury;
				- a person found unresponsive for unknown reasons;
				- a strong blow to the lower jaw, head, or torso;
				- a person has been struck by lightning or eletrocuted;
				-IMPORTANT: a person who has a suspected head, neck, or spinal injury may also have a pelvic injury. Do not put pressure on the pelvis and treat as a head, neck, or spinal injury.

		1- Check: the scene quickly to figure out if the local is safe for you.
	        Check the person:
				- if the person is responsive;
				- Check the person´s ABCs; 
				Look for (physical signs):
				- severe pain or pressure in the head, neck, or back;
				- blood or other fluids draining from the ears or nose;
				- unusual bumps or depressions;
				- bruises, especially around the eyes and behind the ears;

		2- Call: Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED.

		3- Care: 
				- once you reach the person, make sure the head and spine move as little as possible by placing your hands on both sides of the person´s head. Gently support the person´s head in the position in which you found it until EMS personnel arrive;		
				- if the person is wearing a helmet, leave it on unless it makes it difficult for you to ensure the ABCs are present;
				- is the ABCs are present, perform a secondary survey as best as you can without letting go of the person´s head. If there is another First Aider or bystander, have him or her help you;
				- provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive;
                - IMPORTANT: (1) remenber your gloves and other barrier devices;
							 (2) you can stabilize the spine and head when the person is lying down, sitting, or standing by holding his or her head with both of your hands;
							 (3) you don´t always have to roll the person onto his or her back to check for breathing. If you hear a cry of pain, see chest movement, or hear the sound of breathing, it means the person is breathing;
							 (4) if the person vomits, carrefully roll him or her onto one side to keep the airway clear;
							 (5) leave the person in the position he or she was found unless the person is in immediate danger or has life-threatening conditions that need immediate attention;
							 (6) any injury that is serious enough to fracture or dislocate the jaw, nose or other facil bones can cause other head and/or spine injuries.
		4- Moving a person with a head and/or spine injury:
			A log roll is the safest way to move a person with a head and/or spine injury. You should do this if:
				- you need to clear the person´s airway;
				- you suspect a life-threatening injury on the back;
				- you need to move the person onto somenthing solid to remove them from a dangerous situation;
				-IMPORTANT: Unless you have the proper equipment and training to move a person with a suspected head and/or spine injury, wait for EMS personnel to arrive.


    - BONES, MUSCLE AND JOINT INJURIES: there are four basic types of bone, muscle, and joint injuries: STRAIN, SPRAIN, DISLOCATION AND FRACTURE;
				- STRAIN: the stretching or tearing of muscles or tendons;
				- SPRAIN: the stretching or tearing of ligaments at a joint;
				- DISLOCATION: the movement of a bone out of its normal position at a joint;
				- FRACTURE: a chip, crack or break in a bone;
		1- Check: the scene quickly to figure out if the local is safe for you.
	        Check the person:
				- if the person is responsive;
				- Check the person´s ABCs; 
				Look for: 
				- deformity, swelling or bruising;
				- limited or no use of the injured body part;
				- bone fragments sticking out of the skin;

		2-Call: You should always call EMS/9-1-1 if:

				- you cannot safely move the person;

		3- Care: Treat the injury using the RICE method:
				- R est: have the person rest comfortably;
				- I mmobilize: keep the injured area as still as possible;
				- C ool: cool the injured area for 20 min of every hour;
				- E levate: raise the injury, as long as this does not increase the pain;						

    - SHOCK: Shock happens when the vital organs do not get enough exygen-rich blood. It is a very common condition that can affect the people involved in an emergency situation. Treat shock very seriously: it can be fatal.
	Bystanders and First Aiders can be affected by emotional shock. Although this condition is not fatal, you should watch for it and treat it if it occurs. 
	    1- It is often caused by:
				-Too much blood loss;
				- Extensive burns;
				- Too much fluid loss because of diarrhea and vomiting (especially in children);
				- A weak heart;
